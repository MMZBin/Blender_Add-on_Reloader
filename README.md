# Blender Addon Auto Reloader

Monitor for updates to files contained in your developing Blender add-ons and reload them automatically.

This add-on was inspired by [WatchAddon](https://github.com/SaitoTsutomu/WatchAddon).

## Usage
- Install this add-on and set the name of the add-on to be reloaded from the settings.

    - If the name of the add-on and the folder name where the add-on exists are different, specify them separately.

- Press the "Start Monitoring" button in the "Addon Reloader" panel in the "Tools" tab to start monitoring, and press it again to stop monitoring.
